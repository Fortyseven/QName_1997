=========================
    Fixed what was probably something that, at another time, would never have
    been fixable by me...but I figured it out.  I had an off-by-one problem
    in the main name string (cur_name), and was writing to the next byte
    after the end of the space allocated for it.  Amazingly, that next byte
    was the Character Pointer (cp), that was keeping track of where I was in
    the string.  Since I was blotting out the next char with a NULL
    character, it was setting the cp to 0, rather than just staying at 28 or
    whatever the max is set to.  The damned thing was resetting the name
    because of that.  On a whim, I looked at the variable declarations, and
    sure enough, I'd decalared them one after another (cur_name, and then
    cp).  It had never really sunk in that the variables would be allocated
    so close together, even though the alternative makes less sense. :P   So,
    now, thats gone.

    Also, before tackling that, I added a new opening title sequence.  Yeah,
    I agree that it's unnecessary, and quite excessive, but hey, I had fun.
    Also, you can bypass it by just passing ANY command line.  Just a little
    thing I did for fun.

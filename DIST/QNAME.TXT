				    QName

QName helps those who enjoy multiplayer QuakeWorld and want to easily create 
one of those spiffy "graphical" names that we see all over the place. ;)

What it is, is those characters are not, for the most part, straight ASCII
characters, so you have to have a chart with ASCII codes, and a chart with
Quake characters and translate between them.

With this program, you can visually create your spiffy name, and save it to a
.CFG file without the need to use a table to look up your characters.

I recommend adding the following to your AUTOEXEC.CFG file in your /quake/id1
directory:

	exec name.cfg

Then make your sig in QNAME (by clicking on the letters, using the right
mouse button to backspace), and press [ESC] to quit.  A dialog box will pop
up so you can save your name.  Save it, and place it in your /quake/id1
directory.  Then, when you want to change your name, or change it around, you
can just make a new one, and overwrite the file, and everything is done.  No
cutting and pasting required.

There is another Quake name program out there, but it's for Windows.  I hate
Windows only apps.

This is why I wrote QNAME.

QNAME is a quick fast DOS alternative written in about a day with DJGPP and
Allegro.  (Which, BTW, works fine under Windows 95 if you're into that sort 
of thing...:))

All graphics are property of iD Software, and ripped from the .PAK files of
the registered version.

If there is demand, I'll include keyboard support so you won't need to use a
mouse.

Oh, and QNAME is a DJGPP app, so it requires a DPMI server.  CWSDPMI has been
included, but can be run under any DPMI server, including Windows' DOS box.

Anyways, see you in QuakeWorld.  I use the name "Fourty Seven" most of the
time...and I usually wind up playing TeamFortress.  It's my new addiciton. ;)

Bugs?  Free hardware?  Send me some mail.  Be sure to put "QNAME" somewhere
in the subject.

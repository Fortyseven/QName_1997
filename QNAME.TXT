THE STORY SO FAR
----------------

	Being pissed with people actually charging money for such a
simplistic tool, I decided to write my own.  You know the drill, I'd written
it for myself, but then decided that everyone might find use for it, so I put
a copy of the original up on my homepage, and told Blues News about it (and
was greeted with an overwhelming response of silence, but I hear that they do
that sort of thing nowadays, it's all the rage).

	Anyways, forward about a month or two (or four), and I find out that
some locals started a clan called Nova Marines (previously, Clan 203).  I'd
been asked before if I wanted to join, but I declined, though, this time I
took them up on their offer.  Turns out it was a good move.  I'd vowed never
to join a clan, but for some reason, being the hypocritical bastard I can
often be, I was lured in by how cool everyone was, and hey, they were in the
same local calling area, or around there, and not scattered all over the
globe. :) Turns out they were very talented Team Fortress players (among
other popular games), so I was in good Quake 1 company. :)

	As time went on, Tintivilous[NOVA] was on my homepage and saw the
small QNAME archive I'd posted, and wanted to link to it from the Nova
homepage.  By that time, I'd long forgotten about QNAME, but still had the
development directory on my drive, so I told 'em to hold off a little so I
could spruce it up, and get rid of some bugs.

	This is what you have in a dir on your drive right now. :)

	I know of at least one bug (pressing [ENTER] creates a char in your
name, but if you save it, it saves as a carriage return), but I'm sure there
are plenty of little bastards just waiting for me to upload this before they
come out to party. :P

	I'll add things if I can, like perhaps Quake 2 'fun name' support,
which I'm told was added to the latest Q2 patch (I'll have to double check
that one).  But for the most part, my time will be spent on another 'little'
project of mine (and several others) which you can read a little bit about at
hacsoft.home.ml.org's project page.


THE MEANS
---------

	1. Type QNAME.
	2. See lame intro.  (Put anything on the command line to skip!)
	3. Press a key.
	4. Start typing, or clicking.
	5. Press [ESC]
	6. Choose your destiny, or press [ESC] again to QUIT.  (Careful!)

THE END
-------

	Bye!
